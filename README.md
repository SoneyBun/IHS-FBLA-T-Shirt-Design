<!-- Initial Thoughts -->
## üß† Initial Thoughts
I wanted the T-Shirt to be simple, not too much going on. Just a logo on a shirt with minimal designs.

I first thought i could add the IHS Patterns to the FBLA Logo, however the result wasn't to my satisfaction. The white stripes wouldn't look too well with the white background, which in some cases makes it difficult to use on a t-shirt. I then settled on adding the FBLA Color theme on the IHS Tiger.

## üñåÔ∏è Creation
To see if the yellow paired well with the IHS Tiger, I made a low quality version in photoshop. The result came out to this.

The image wasn't enough to decide off of, so I kept going into this design. I made the following 3 images

When stacked, the three images result in the following:

I was satisfied with this result.

My next step was to incorporate the FBLA Logo, as the instructions state that it's required. I decided on replacing the Stars in the Original IHS Tiger with Whited-out FBLA Logos.

There were minor flaws in this image, however when merging all the photos together, I fixed it.

Putting the image on a T-shirt would result in:
